It's hard to believe that grounding is a real thing! There are two proven ways in which grounding affects the body electrically. \n1. The Earth gives off free electrons!

The body uses these free electrons to replace the electrons lost from atoms on molecules that have been damaged by free radicals.\n\n2.There is a double blind randomised trial done on 10 participants that showed grounding dramatically thinned the blood by increasing the zeta potential of the red blood cells.
